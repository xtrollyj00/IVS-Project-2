In 'vystup.pdf' are results of profiling (callgrind). Input files were of different sizes (10, 100 , 1000).

We can see, that our functions Power() and Add() are called most often (and spend the most time of our functions).  

To be more precise, in these functions function IsValid() is called the most (actually, it is called by all our functions that perform computations).
Therefore it is reasonable to focus on optimizing this function.

Function SetAnswer() is called by all our functions performing computation, so if there is some optimization possible here, it would be also helpful.
Similarly with the function IsNatural() (but not called by all our computing functions) but called each time Power() is called.

Conclusion: we should concentrate on optimizing IsValid() function in the first place, which is called by all our computing functions.
