Reality was much different from plans. As we can see, we had lot of work
during semester and there was very little motivation for our team to work
on the project such far from deadline. 

The biggest part of work was done before deadline, when all or time was
concentrated on projects. 

Every team member did his work well, but not in time, including team leader.
The only solution to this problem is to set more realistic deadlines.
